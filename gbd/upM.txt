Presentation on their technology and product Their 1st screening process is planting in various soil sample. Then good yield soil will be qualified and it goes to next step. (They call this qualified soil “enriched sample”). Then, strain will be extracted from the enriched sample and the strains will be screened by their computation process. The screening criteria is efficacy and commercialization. Then they identify the most promising strains. They have launched 2 products, Thrivus (bio stimulant) and LAV311 (bio fungicide). Thrivus is registered as bio fertilizer in US and Canada. The registration is held by Lavie. It is sold by Lavie’s commercial team (they call it direct model). The main crop is wheat. The efficacy depends on soil profile. (they do not analyze soil) LAV311 is WDG and WP formulation and licensed exclusively and globally to Corteva.(they call it licensing model). Their collaboration models are the above 2 models. They are looking for partners who are capable for strategic market know-how, production, or go to market. Open opportunity for Sumi Agro Their next bio control product is LAV321. Trials have been done in lab, GH, and field in 2022 and 2023 by Corteva, Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta. 2024 is the final filed trial year and the regulatory process and the negotiation for the global licensing contract will start in 2025. None of the aforementioned 4 partners has any special right on LAV321 therefore this product is open also for Sumi Agro to participate next year’s filed trial and the negotiation following the trial. Corteva holds first refusal right on LAV441 and 442 and no other special right.
